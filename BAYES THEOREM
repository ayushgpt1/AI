# Example: Calculate P(King|Face)
# P(King): Probability that the card is a king
prior_King = 4 / 52

# P(Face): Probability that a card is a face card
prior_Face = 12 / 52  # 3 face cards (J, Q, K) per suit, 4 suits total

# P(Face|King): Probability of face card given it's a king
likelihood_Face_given_King = 1  # If it's a king, it is also a face card

# Applying Bayes' Theorem
